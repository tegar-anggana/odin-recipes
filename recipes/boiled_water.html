    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Boiling means bringing water to 100 degrees Celcius for cooking. But you
      donâ€™t need a thermometer to boil water. The process to boil water (or any
      other kind of liquid) is simple, and you need to follow only a few steps.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put some water in a pan or pot. Don't fill it to the top, or the water
        will splash out of the pan when it boils!
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the pan on your stovetop and turn the burner to the highest
        setting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the water come to a full rolling boil (when the bubbles are rapidly
        breaking the surface). Covering the pot speeds the process by trapping
        surface heat.
